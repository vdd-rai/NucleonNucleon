# NucleonNucleon

This repository contains the scripts used to perform the numerical calculations of the master thesis ''Nucleon-nucleon potentials from generalized Skyrme models''.

Below is a brief description of the purpose of each script:

- hedgehog_1S.nb - Solve the field equations for different Skyrme models to obtain the profile functions.
- sample.py - Generate the (r,Q) values.
- interp.py - Interpolate the profile function on the points needed subsequently.
- prod.py - Generate a field given by the product approximation.
- deriv_y.py - Generate the derivatives of the field w.r.t (y1,y2,y3).
- deriv_x.py - Generate the derivatives of the field w.r.t (x1,x2,x3).
- deriv_Q.py - Generate the derivatives of the field w.r.t (Q1,Q2).
- metric,py - Generate the components of the metric.
- fourier.py - Generate the Fourier coefficients.
